Here’s a typical folder structure you could use for your ZerokeyUSB project repository, inspired by best practices for open-source projects like SeedSigner and Flipper Zero:

Recommended Folder Structure:

ZerokeyUSB/
├── docs/
├── firmware/
├── hardware/
├── software/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   └── tests/
├── images/
├── examples/
├── scripts/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── INSTALL.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── SECURITY.md

Explanation of Each Folder/File:

1. docs/: Contains documentation related to your project (setup guides, user manuals, API docs). This is where you can add more detailed usage or setup instructions, or technical details.


2. firmware/: Any firmware binaries or code that runs on the ZerokeyUSB hardware. It’s important to store all versions of the firmware here and make it easily accessible to users.


3. hardware/: Contains schematics, CAD files, or diagrams of the hardware design. This can include the PCB layouts, enclosure designs, or any related manufacturing details.


4. software/: Contains software for managing or interfacing with ZerokeyUSB. For instance, any companion app or desktop tool to interact with the device could go here.


5. src/: Source code related to the firmware and software. It’s a good idea to separate it into main/ for production code and tests/ for testing code.


6. images/: A folder to store images used in the README or other documentation (like screenshots, diagrams, or marketing materials).


7. examples/: Code examples or usage guides that show how to use your project. This is especially useful for new users to get started quickly.


8. scripts/: Any helper scripts (such as build scripts, installation scripts, or automation tools) that help in development or deployment.


9. .github/workflows/: GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD purposes, such as automating tests or releases.


10. LICENSE: The license file for your project. You can include the MIT License or any other license you choose for ZerokeyUSB.


11. README.md: The main introduction and documentation for your project. This will provide users with an overview, installation steps, features, and usage instructions.


12. CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines on how to contribute to the project (opening issues, submitting pull requests, coding style).


13. INSTALL.md: Detailed instructions on how to install and set up ZerokeyUSB on different platforms.


14. CHANGELOG.md: A log of changes made in each version of the project. This helps users see the progress and updates.


15. SECURITY.md: A file to describe how to report security vulnerabilities, if applicable to your project.



This structure keeps the repository organized, makes it easier for contributors to navigate, and provides clear documentation for users to follow. Let me know if you'd like more detail on any specific folder!
